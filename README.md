# Skewness-and-Kurtosis

Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing skewness and kurtosis in the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of its features. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution, while kurtosis measures the peakedness or flatness relative to a normal distribution.

About the Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains measurements of various features of iris flowers from three different species. The key features include:

SepalLengthCm: Sepal length in centimeters SepalWidthCm: Sepal width in centimeters PetalLengthCm: Petal length in centimeters PetalWidthCm: Petal width in centimeters

Data Preprocessing
Loading Data:
Loaded the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame for inspection.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing Distributions:
Created distribution plots for SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, and PetalWidthCm using seaborn and matplotlib to understand their distributions.

Skewness and Kurtosis Analysis
Descriptive Statistics:
Calculated basic descriptive statistics for the features in the dataset.

Calculating Skewness and Kurtosis:
Added skewness and kurtosis values to the descriptive statistics table to understand the asymmetry and peakedness of each feature.

Visualizing Skewness and Kurtosis:
Plotted the distributions of the features again to visually inspect the skewness and kurtosis.

Conclusion
The analysis demonstrated the application of skewness and kurtosis in understanding the distribution of features in the Iris dataset. Key findings include:

The skewness values indicate the asymmetry of each feature's distribution. The kurtosis values provide insights into the peakedness or flatness of the distributions relative to a normal distribution. These insights highlight the importance of skewness and kurtosis in statistical analysis, as they provide valuable information about the shape and characteristics of the data distribution. This understanding can guide further analysis and modeling efforts, especially in identifying and addressing any potential issues related to data distribution.
